I (30M) live with my girlfriend, Lily (not a real name), and our 3 month old daughter.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.497
Lily is incredibly kind and always puts others first.

00:00:09.497 --> 00:00:14.727
One of her old friends, Jenna, came over last weekend after not seeing Lily for a while.

00:00:14.727 --> 00:00:21.932
I've never liked Jenna, she always makes everything about herself.While I was in the kitchen, Lily started breastfeeding our baby in the living room.

00:00:21.932 --> 00:00:27.275
Jenna suddenly said, That's gross, no one wants to see that, implying it was inappropriate.

00:00:27.275 --> 00:00:32.280
Lily came into the kitchen upset and continued feeding there, visibly shaken.I was pissed.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.847
No one makes the mother of my child feel ashamed for feeding our baby, especially not in our own home.

00:00:37.847 --> 00:00:42.140
I walked in, saw Jenna rummaging through our things, and told her to get out.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.707
She acted confused, so I told her I wasn't asking twice.

00:00:45.707 --> 00:00:52.062
She left.Later that night, Jenna called Lily and claimed I threatened her and said we were lucky she wasn't calling the cops.

00:00:52.062 --> 00:00:57.005
I took the phone, told her to never contact us again, and blocked her.I don't regret it.

00:00:57.005 --> 00:01:00.772
A baby needs to eat, and there's nothing wrong with a mom breastfeeding.

00:01:00.772 --> 00:01:02.512
So, Am I the asshole H?
